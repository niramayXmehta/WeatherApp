Hello! This is the quick guide to run our project.

Prerequisites:
> node.js installed including npm

To run the project unzip the file, after that open Powershell/terminal

Using the cd function, navigate to the unzipped folder (for example cd Downloads; cd photocast) and run the following commands:

> npm i -D react-router-dom@latest
(this downloads soem dependencies needed.)

> npm install

> npm start

It also should work with yarn (yarn install, yarn start), but we have not tested it

After that, the app will open in the default browser at the following link:

> https://localhost:3000

To have the best experience use the default aspect ratio of your laptop/PC screen.
